# gen2ntuple
scripts for making and analyzing DL Gen2 ntuples

## software setup

### dependencies

* ROOT is needed for all scripts
* The ubdl software environment must be setup to run the ntuple maker (`make_dlgen2_flat_ntuples.py`). See the quick start section of the readme in the [ubdl repository](https://github.com/LArbys/ubdl) for instructions

### first time setup

Before running the ntuple maker, you need to compile a C++ script in the `helpers` directory (this creates a shared C++ library used for the fiducial volume calculation). To do this, simply run:

```
cd helpers/
source compile_wirecell_fiducial_volume.sh
```

This only needs to be done once after first downloading the repository.

## Running the ntuple maker

The `make_dlgen2_flat_ntuples.py` script produces ntuple files from input larflowreco files and merged_dlreco files. It allows or requires the following options:

* __-f__ / __--files__: The input larflowreco files that will be processed (__required__). You can either provide a text file where each line in the file is the full path to a larflowreco file, the path to a single larflowreco file, or a space separated list of larflowreco files.
* __-t__ / __--truth__: The merged_dlreco files matching the input larflowreco files (__required__). This must be a text file where each line is the full path to a merged_dlreco file. This text file can include a full list of all merged_dlreco files in some sample, it does not need to be restricted to the merged_dlreco files that match the larflowreco files supplied with --files. The script will go through the input merged_dlreco files and find the ones with the same hash identifier as the input larflowreco files.
* __-w__ / __--weightfile__: The path to the file (a pickled python dictionary) containing the cross section weights (__required for MC inputs__). Check the `event_weighting` dir to see if there is a weights file there that matches your sample. If not, there are instructions in that directory on how to create one. This should not be supplied for data input but must be supplied for MC input.
* __-m__ / __--model_path__: The path to the pytorch checkpoint file containing the weights to run the LArPID network. The path to the most recent weights file on the Tufts cluster is `/cluster/tufts/wongjiradlabnu/mrosen25/prongCNN/models/checkpoints/run3bOverlays_quadTask_plAll_2inChan_5ClassHard_minHit10_b64_oneCycleLR_v2me05_noPCTrainOrVal/ResNet34_recoProng_5class_epoch20.pt`
* __-d__ / __--device__: The device to run the LArPID network on ("cpu" or "gpu"). Default: "cpu"
* __-mc__ / __--isMC__: A flag that __must be supplied when running over MC input__
* __-ana__ / __--dlana_input__: A flag that __must be supplied when running over dlana input__ (truth files that begin with "merged_dlana" instead of "merged_dlreco"
* __-o__ / __--outfile__: The name of the output ntuple file (default: "dlgen2_flat_ntuple.root")
* __-nkp__ / __--noKeypoints__: A flag, when supplied the keypoint variables will not be saved in the output ntuple. __Required when running over larflowreco files with version < v2_me_06__. (Older larflowreco files don't have the keypoint info.)
* __--multiGPU__: A flag, supply to run LArPID network on multiple gpus. (This really isn't necessary, the network runs pretty quickly on just a cpu.)

There are two scripts included in this repository to provide an example of how to submit ntuple maker jobs on the Tufts cluster using slurm:
* tufts_submit_ntuple_job_example.sh
* tufts_run_ntuple_maker.sh

We produce ntuple files as part of the standard processing, but if you want to add a variable or two and reprocess the ntuples from existing larflowreco files, then you can take a look at these scripts for an example on how that can be done. If you'd like to use them, then __first copy__ both scripts and then edit the following lines:
* __tufts_submit_ntuple_job_example.sh__
    * line 18: supply the full file path to a text file containing all the larflowreco files you'd like to process. Each line should be the full path to one larflowreco file
    * line 19: supply the full file path to a text file containing all the merged_dlreco or merged_dlana files that match the larflowreco files. Each line should be the full path to one merged_dlreco or merged_dlana file. The file on a particular line of this list need not match the larflowreco file on the same line of the larflowreco list. The scripts select larflowreco files to process, then searches through the supplied merged_dlreco/dlana list to find the matching files.
    * line 13: change this NFILES variable to the number of files you want to process per job. I usually do 100
    * lines 3-11: edit the slurm sbatch options as necessary. You'll want to at least change the `--array` option, which dictates how many jobs are submitted. This option works with the NFILES variable on line 13 to determine which larflowreco files from the line 18 list are processed in which job. For example, using `--array=0-3,6` and `NFILES=100` will submit five jobs (with arrayIDs 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6), each of which will process 100 files given by those specified on lines arrayID\*NFILES + 1 to arrayID\*NFILES + NFILES.
    * line 17: provide the full file path to the `tufts_run_ntuple_maker.sh` script
    * line 20: the filename (not path!) of the weight file in the event_weighting directory that will get passed to `make_dlgen2_flat_ntuples.py` with the `-w` option (see above).
    * line 21: supply an output tag that will be included in output file names
    * line 26: edit, as necessary, the end of this line where you see `-mc`. In this example, `-mc` (and any other options you might add to the end of the source command after it) is passed to the `make_dlgen2_flat_ntuples.py` script as a flag. So, for example, if you were running over data, you would remove `-mc`. If you were running over data with merged_dlana input and you didn't want to save keypoint information, you would change `-mc` to `-ana -nkp`.
* __tufts_run_ntuple_maker.sh__
    * line 5: supply the path to your copy of this gen2ntuple repository
    * line 22: supply the path to your compiled and installed copy of the ubdl repository
    * line 41: supply the directory you would like output files copied to
    * line 42: supply the directory you would like log files copied to

All of the files processed in a single job will, at the end, get merged together before being copied over to the specified output directory. So each job will produce one output file named make_dlgen2_flat_ntuples_OUTTAG_output_ARRAYID.root and one log file (in addition to the usual slurm .out file) named make_dlgen2_flat_ntuples_OUTTAG_ARRAYID.log, where OUTTAG is the output tag (specified on line 21 of `tufts_submit_ntuple_job_example.sh`) and ARRAYID is the slurm array ID (all specified on line 8 of `tufts_submit_ntuple_job_example.sh` will be run) of the job. You can use the root `hadd` command to merge the output root files

## using ntuple files

See the following section for full documentation of all ntuple variables.

The ntuples are flat ROOT files containing information about reconstructed neutrino interactions and (for Monte Carlo samples) truth information about the simulated neutrino interactions. If you are new to ROOT, this [ROOT Guide For Beginners](https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/primer/ROOTPrimerLetter.pdf) provides a nice, detailed introduction.

For Monte Carlo samples, the ntuples also contain information about the number of protons on target (POT) that would produce the full sample contained in the ntuple.

I have provided an example script, `example_ntuple_analysis_script.py`, that you can take a look at to see how to use the POT data and how to pull some basic information out of the ntuple files using ROOT in python (PyROOT). This script takes as input an ntuple file made from an MC bnb nu overlay sample, makes histograms of true and reconstructed neutrino and primary muon energies, scales the output histograms to the number of events expected for 6.67e+20 POT, and writes these histograms to an output root file.

To run:
```
python example_ntuple_analysis_script.py -i input_ntuple_file.root -o output_histogram_file.root
```

You can then view the histograms in `output_histogram_file.root` in e.g. a ROOT TBrowser:
```
root -l output_histogram_file.root
root [0] new TBrowser
```

### Event filters:

* An entry will appear in the flat ntuple files for every input data event
* For MC simulation, events that meet the following criteria are excluded and will not appear in these file:
    * SCE corrected neutrino interaction vertex is outside the wire cell fiducial volume
    * The event’s cross-section weight is unknown or infinite

### potTree variables:

The potTree (present only in ntuples produced from MC samples) provide information about the number of protons on target (POT) that would produce the full sample contained in the ntuple. There is one entry for each merged_dlreco file used to create the ntuple file. To get the full POT count, add up all the entries in the tree.

Variables:

* __totPOT__: total POT for the file represented by this entry
* __totGoodPOT__: total good POT for the file represented by this entry

I am not entirely sure what the distinction is between the "total POT" and "total good POT" reported in merged_dlreco files, but the two are always the same in every sample I've looked at. I would recomment using `totGoodPOT` and ignoring the `totPOT` entries.

### EventTree file/event identification variables:

* __fileid__: File ID number for larflowreco file that this event was from. Can be used to locate the larflowreco and merged_dlreco files for a particular event
